    Bachelor project, written by TRA0163, showcasing 
    reductions between these NP-complete problems:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>3-SAT to H-Cycle</li>
    <ul>
        <li>H-Cycle to H-Circuit</li>
        <ul>
            <li>H-Circuit to TSP</li>            
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>3-SAT to SSP</li>
    <li>3-SAT to 3DM</li>
    <ul>
        <li>3DM to SSP</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
